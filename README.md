Hi, This is Faris Malaeb, I enjoy automating manual processes, mainly infrastructure scripting.  and PowerShell is the perfect platform for this. 

You will a lot of scripts and post in my site www.powershellcenter.com and here, most of them are to address an issue or make the job done faster.

Check the scripts over here, feel free and pull and submit your changes.
